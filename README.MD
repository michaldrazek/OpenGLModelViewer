# OpenGLModelViewer
A simple model viewer, made as an OpenGL "Hello World" using various tutorials and also my own logic. <br>Uses GLFW, GLEW, glm, [stb-image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) and [tinyobjloader](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader). It loads an .obj file and currently supports meshes with a singular material and texture.<br>
